- patient condition
would be nice to implement this
stable, critical, emergency
those awaiting assessment can be 'unknown'
GOOD - patient is comfortable, okay within the 
normal measures
FAIR - uncomfortable though the vital signs are
alright, indicators can be questions, acutely ill
CRITICAL - indicators are unfavorable, unstable vital 
signs, patient is either unconscious, fall under
emergencies sudden accidents

- cases after patient treatment
1. can be released
2. can be transfered

okay, so i want to make make a car inventory system with python drawing libraries (tkinter or turtle). 
first, the idea is to draw vehicles. each vehicle is to have some information about it displayed together with the drawn car (perhaps we can have the data in json and import into the main script). the vehicles should have different colors - thinking of using random rgb color code for this case. additionally, have a button 'show next car' that allows user to show the next drawn car with its correct details imported to the displaying window. the length of a given vehicle should vary and be of random length in every call of the draw-car function. we can display one car at a given time with its detail.
secondly, a random color generator function, we could have a function that can randomly generate a given color in rgb format, this could be imported to the main python script since it is used in two scenarios (cars and the flowers).
thirdly, a function to draw 6 flowers along the frame (edges) of the window displaying the cars. was thinking of using the window dimensions to know where to place the 6 flowers equidistant to each other. the flowers should also be able to change their colors - if it is possible to have roses drawn, then the petals can change in color.

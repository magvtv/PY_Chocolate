If you want a thing bad enough, 
To go out and fight for it,
Work day and night for it,
Give up your time and your peace and your sleep for it,

If only the desire for it,
Makes you mad enough, 
Never to tire for it,
Makes you hold all other things tawdry and cheap for it,

If life seems all empy and useless without it, 
And all that you scheme and you dream is about it, 
If gladly you will sweat and fret and plan for it,
Lose all your terror of opposition or man for it, 

If you simply go after that which you want, 
With all your capacity, strength and sagacity,
Faith, hope, confidence and stern pertinacity,
If neither cold, poverty, famish nor gaunt,
Nor sickness nor pain of body or brain, 
Can turn you away from it,

IF DOGGED AND GRIM YOU BESIEGE AND BESET IT, 
YOU WILL GET IT!
